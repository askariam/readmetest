## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.


### Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
psql capstone < capstone-test.pgsql
```
Or just use the manage.py file to migrate the database.

```bash
python manage.py db init
python manage.py db migrate
python manage.py db upgrade
```

```bash
source setup.sh
export FLASK_APP=flask
flask run --reload
``` 

## Testing

Uncomment the below line in the setup.sh:
export DATABASE_URL='postgres://localhost:5432/capstone_test' #comment this line if not using test_app.py
and run again:
```
